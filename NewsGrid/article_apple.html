               <p>
                  After two years of rumors, at this year’s (virtual) World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC), Apple
                  finally announced that it was going to migrate all its Mac products from Intel processors to the
                  company’s own Arm-based silicon. It is expected that Apple Mac products based on a future version of
                  its upcoming A14 system-on-chip (SoC) will be similar to the A14 for the iPhone and iPads but
                  optimized for higher thermal limits offered in Mac products. Through out the WWDC presentation, Apple
                  called the new processors “Apple Silicon” and never mentioned the Arm instruction set used by its A
                  series of processors.
               </p>
               <p>
                  From a hardware perspective, Apple probably could have made the move sooner, as its iPad processors
                  were shown to be roughly comparable to older Intel Core i5 processors. Apple took the extra time to
                  make sure it had a smooth transition story and it provided support for all the legacy software running
                  on the macOS with Rosetta 2 emulation technology. To get developers started, Apple is offering them a
                  Mac Mini with an A12Z processor and the beta version of the macOS Big Sur operating system that will
                  support the new Apple processors.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Apple will still offer Intel-based MacBooks and desktop Mac products for the next two years as it
                  transitions to the Apple Silicon. With control over the entire hardware and software design, Apple
                  should be able to close any performance gap with mainstream Intel processors quickly while doing what
                  it does best — offering a great user experience. Apple’s stated goal is to deliver desktop CPU
                  performance at notebook power levels.
               </p>

               <h3><b>Apple gets an A for CPU design</b></h3>

               <p>
                  By replacing Intel processors with its own A-series of Arm processors, Apple gains more control over
                  the platform and further differentiates itself from Windows PCs. While Apple may lose some very
                  high-end performance in desktop systems, the Arm architecture has shown to be very power efficient and
                  still offer good performance, making it ideal for thin and light laptops.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Another reason for Apple to move to its own A series SoCs is the slowing of Moore’s Law. Process
                  shrinks are getting fewer and farther in between and Intel stumbled getting to 10nm while Apple’s A
                  series foundry TSMC is in volume production on 7nm and already ramping 5nm. Apple gains more control
                  over its roadmap because even if TSMC stumbles, it can go elsewhere, even potentially to Intel, for
                  foundry services.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Apple can also change the definition of a PC with its own processor and more heterogeneous computing.
                  PCs now trail smart phones in advancing personal technology. Smartphone processors include DSPs and
                  neural net processors, as well as multiple sensors, along with the standard CPU, GPU and I/O and
                  memory. The move from Intel x86 to its A-Series processors is an opportunity for Apple to reinvent the
                  Mac and make it more user-centric. It could mean computers that are more portable, more flexible, and
                  more intuitive. This would really be an opportunity for Apple to differentiate itself from the rest of
                  industry even further.
               </p>

               <h3><b>Third time’s a charmThird time’s a charm</b></h3>

               <p>
                  This is also a good time to remember that Apple has gone through CPU instruction set transition
                  several times before. The first instruction set transition for Apple Macs was from the Motorola 68000
                  architecture used in the original 1984 Macintosh computers to the Apple/IBM/Motorola designed PowerPC
                  in 1994. Twelve years later, in 2006, Apple transitioned from the PowerPC to the Intel processors.
                  Each transition caused short-term disruptions in performance that were later corrected by new native
                  software. This current era of Intel Core processors will have lasted about 15 years when Apple begins
                  the real transition in 2021, which would be the longest Apple has utilized the same instruction set
                  since the Apple II.
               </p>

               <p>
                  This is also a great opportunity for Apple to further blend two of its major operating systems: iPadOS
                  and macOS. The two are on a path towards greater unity, and now it will be easier to run iPadOS and
                  iOS applications on Macs. By bringing the two operating systems closer together, Apple will more
                  seamlessly integrate its product lines and create a continuum of computing platforms, as opposed to
                  discretely different platforms with different use cases. This could also boost App Store revenue by
                  offering developers the opportunity to write one application and have it run on all of Apple’s
                  platforms in a single binary.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Cutting Intel processors out of Mac for its own A-Series processors will undoubtedly lower supply
                  chain costs and increase margins, but I see no evidence Apple will cut the price of the Mac. By
                  building the entire system, including its own processor, hardware and software, Apple will become more
                  fully integrated than any other consumer computer company.
               </p>
