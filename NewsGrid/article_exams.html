               <p>
                  State universities in Telangana have got some relief at the time of Pandemic in regards to the
                  academics. As per the official notification, the students from Intermediate semesters don’t have to
                  attend the final exams. On the other hand, the final-year UG, PG exams, which were scheduled from July
                  20, 2020, has been postponed. The final decision on the cancellation of final-year exams will be taken
                  soon. Keep checking this page for the latest updates.
               </p>

               <p>
                  The students who are in the intermediate semesters will be promoted to the next semester without
                  taking into consideration the previous backlogs. However, it is important for the students to score a
                  required credit in the examination which will be conducted by the Varsities. The decision has been
                  taken by the varsity authorities in lieu of the Coronavirus Pandemic. As the exam will be conducted
                  for only the final year students, it will be much easier to maintain Social Distancing in the exam
                  hall.
               </p>

               <p>
                  The exams for unconventional degrees will be conducted in two parts; one for B.Com and second for BA
                  and BSc. As per the new rules, the exam will be conducted for 2 hours instead of 3 hours and the
                  syllabus will be modified accordingly. In order to compensate for the reduced exam hours, the students
                  will also be provided with some additional choices in the paper.
               </p>

               <h3><b>Guidelines for Telangana UG, PG Examinations </b> </h3>

               <p>
                  UGC formed a committee to recommend how examinations can be conducted amidst this coronavirus crisis
                  that has in a way crippled the education system of the country. Based on the recommendations received
                  by the committee, the UGC has prepared a set of rules to conduct the UG and PG examinations to ensure
                  the students do not lose a semester or a year. The same has been forwarded to the Vice-Chancellor of
                  each University. TSCHE also conducted a meeting to discuss the rules and recommendations of UGC and
                  came up with a set recommendation of which the highlights have been provided below -
