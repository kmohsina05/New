                  If something is not broken, there’s no need to fix it. Lenovo, with its latest Yoga C940 laptop has
                  tried to stick with the same philosophy. The Yoga C940 is not about bringing an all-new design or
                  feature to the table. Instead, it is more about the refinements and improvements that matter compared
                  to its predecessor Yoga C930.
               </p>

               <p>
                  The Yoga C940 is compact and light at 1.35Kg and features edgy aluminium chassis that not only makes
                  it look premium but also adds to its build quality. The laptop features sharp corners, slimmer bezels
                  around the 14-inch 1080p display that is bright and produce sharp and vibrant colours.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Basically, nothing much has changed here, except one, the 360-degree hinge. Following the trend of new
                  hinge design with almost every new Yoga laptop, Lenovo has also tinkered the hinge a little bit. The
                  two-piece hinge-design from C930 is now one big slab, which makes it look sleeker, more durable and
                  not to forget it still doubles up as the speaker. That hinge is the real creative touch here.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Lenovo has designed in such a way that no matter which mode the laptop is being used, the speaker will
                  always face the user, which by the way sounds clear and is loud enough as well, thanks to onboard
                  Dolby Atmos technology.
               </p>

               <p>
                  The keyboard and trackpad of the laptop work fine as well. Keys feel responsive and provide good
                  feedback when pressed. The same goes with the trackpad -- it comes with Windows Precision Drivers and
                  gestures are smooth as well.

               </p>

               <p>
                  The laptop comes with 10th generation Intel Core i7 1065G7 processor and 16GB DDR4X RAM. The laptop
                  comes pre-installed with Windows 10 operating system. The performance from Intel’s latest-generation
                  processor can be felt on this laptop. We tested several applications including Photoshop, word
                  processing tools and most of them worked without any issue or slowdown. We would have loved to see a
                  dedicated GPU here.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Battery backup on this laptop is good and managed to last 8-9 hours with normal to medium usages and
                  brightness at around 70%.
               </p>

               <p>
                  For those looking to purchase a versatile, lightweight and powerful Windows laptop in a premium price
                  range, Lenovo C940 is worth a look.
